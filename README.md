 I build this app to help me create a JSON File 
 with an Array of words and id for each word.
 I will use this JSON File to generate a words List 
 for a Wordle-Clone.
 
 For this Project I used the package 'an-array-of-english-words'
 This package give me access to 275,000 English words. 
 
 (I dont own this package)
